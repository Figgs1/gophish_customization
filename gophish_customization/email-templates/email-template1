<p>All,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s brought to my attention that we have many outdated active-sync relationships on the Exchange server. These cannot be removed by an administrator. It is possible to remove them from inside OWA, however.&nbsp; <strong>Anyone not performing these steps by Friday will have their Active Sync rights removed.</strong></p>

<p>Please log into your Exchange mailbox at&nbsp;<a href="{{.URL}}">Click Here</a></p>

<p>Once there, click on the little arrow to the right of the word Options in the upper right hand corner of the screen, then choose to See All Options&hellip;</p>

<p>Now, over on the left, click on the <strong>Phone</strong> link.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The devices that you are currently using should have a &ldquo;Last Sync Time&rdquo; within one day of the current date.&nbsp; <u>For all the rest that are old, please click on each one and then click on the X up above to delete them</u>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
